# 42_so_long
Small 2D game in C using 42's minilibX, also my first graphical project !

The goal is to help Suzy collect skulls for her grave. You need to collect every skull before being able to leave !
There is also a move counter in the terminal.

# Usage:
```console
~ make
~ ./so_long [map]
```
The maps are found in the `map/` folder, but feel free to add your own !
